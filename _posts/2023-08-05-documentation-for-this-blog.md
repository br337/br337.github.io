## About this theme

The theme is maintained [in a repo on my account](https://github.com/DeimosTheMisthios/no-style-please), forked from [someone else's theme of the same name](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). The modifications include:

- Addition of local [Katex v0.16.7](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases/tag/v0.16.7) (CSS/JS/font) files for rendering math on client side. I chose not to go with a CDN hosted version of Katex to have all scripts be hosted on the same domain.
- A dark or light theme button in the top right, and the [associated JS file](/assets/js/mode-change.js). This was obtained from [another user's Github hosted portfolio](https://github.com/fleetimee/portfolio).
- Minor changes like syntax highlighting for code blocks, removal of analytics and SEO plugin, changes to default fonts and code blocks.
- Options to have [uppercase titles](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/pull/21), [commentary appear above the archive page](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/pull/22), [the index content appear on top](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/pull/30), and [display update date in post](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/pull/31).

## Creating a new post

Add a new post to the `_posts` folder with the name `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, with the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) similar to that of this post. The URL used is the `title` from the file name, while the displayed title is sourced from the front matter. The site is tested locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve`, while Github pages deployments are available directly on the [home page](/).

## Sample elements
